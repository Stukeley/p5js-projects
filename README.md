# p5js-projects
Some of my older Creative Coding projects made using p5.js.
Some were initially made with Processing and later "rewritten" using p5. Below you'll find a short description of each project in this repository.

## Bogo Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Radix Sort
Simple visualisations of some sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms Visualised
All four of the above in one project.

## Barnsley Fern
Generates the Barnsley Fern fractal using pre-defined mathematical rules. Five different colour modes, one is assigned at random every time the app is started.

## Chaos Game
Generates the Chaos Game fractal, starting with three random points and then generating additional points in half of the distance the previous point and a random vertex. One colour mode, automatically refreshes roughly once every 3 seconds.

## Game of Life
Imitates Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton, starting with a random set of dead and alive cells, then applying rules to every cell based on how many dead and alive cells there are in its direct neighbourhood.

## Lissajous Curve Table
A table of Lissajous Curves (graphs of parametric equations describing complex harmonic motion) with different parameters in each column and row.

## Matrix Digital Rain
Pretty self-explanatory. Three different colour modes.

## PI Approximation
Approximating PI using the Monte Carlo method. It's highly random, each run of the project will yield a different PI value.

## Sierpinski Triangle
Generates a Sierpinski Triangle for a pre-defined amount of "levels" and changes colour every frame.
